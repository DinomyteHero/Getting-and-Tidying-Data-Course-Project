## Getting-and-Tidying-Data-Course-Project

# Welcome
Welcome to my Getting and Tidying Data project.

# Overview
I used data from the UCI HAR Dataset(https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
to complete this project.

# Objective
The objective of the project was to first tidy the data up and then to only show the data containing the mean and standard deviation functions.
They are in the form of mean() and std().

# End Result
I created the r script "r_analysis.R" in order to achieve the objective.
The "analysed_data.txt" was created from the final dataset(tidy_data2).
